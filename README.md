# 🧠 Diabetes Prediction with ML (SDG 3)

This project uses machine learning and basic NLP to predict diabetes, supporting **SDG 3: Good Health and Well-being**.

## 🔍 Goal
Use patient data and simulated doctor notes to detect diabetes early.

## 📊 Tools
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Random Forest
- TF-IDF (for NLP)

## 🧪 Result
Achieved ~77% accuracy on test data.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install pandas scikit-learn`
2. Place `diabetes.csv` in the same folder
3. Run: `python diabetes_nlp_model.py`
